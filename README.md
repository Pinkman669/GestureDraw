# Hand_tracking

Run "main.py" and "yarn start" to start those two servers.<hr>
## How to Draw:
* Activate drawing mode by doing a OK gesture(Detemined by distance between index and thumb).<br>
* Using two hands to draw oval shape<br>
* Single handed point up to clear
* Single handed and put down your index, middle, ring and pinky finger(Like doing a thumb up but pointing to yourself) to start over

Please move slowly for better hand tracking result.<br>
Bear in mind that lighting in your room will affect tracking performance tremendously.
